# ðŸ”¸ Matrix Addition
âœ… Both matrices must have the same dimensions â€” same number of rows and same number of columns.
Example:
```python
A =  [ [1, 2],
       [3, 4] ]

B =  [ [5, 6],
       [7, 8] ]
```
Both are 2Ã—2 matrices â†’ âœ… We can add them.

--- 

ðŸ”¸ How Do You Add Them?
You simply add each corresponding element.
```python
A + B = [ [1+5, 2+6],
          [3+7, 4+8] ]

      = [ [6, 8],
          [10, 12] ]
```

---

ðŸ”¸ General Formula
If
A = [aáµ¢â±¼] and B = [báµ¢â±¼],
then
A + B = [aáµ¢â±¼ + báµ¢â±¼]

Where i = row number, and j = column number.

---

ðŸ”¸ Python Example Using NumPy
```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

result = A + B
print(result)
```
Output:
```python
[[ 6  8]
 [10 12]]
```

ðŸ”¸ Key Points to Remember
Rule / Concept	Explanation
Same size required	Number of rows and columns must match
Element-wise addition	Add each pair of corresponding elements
Result is same shape	The result will be the same dimension as the input matrices

# ðŸ”¸ Matrix Multiplication
For two matrices A (of size mÃ—n) and B (of size nÃ—p):
âœ… Matrix multiplication is possible only when the number of columns of A = number of rows of B.
A = mÃ—n
B = nÃ—p
Result = mÃ—p

âœ… Example
```python
A = [ [1, 2],
      [3, 4] ]     â†’ 2Ã—2 matrix

B = [ [5, 6],
      [7, 8] ]     â†’ 2Ã—2 matrix

we multiply row by row
[1Ã—5 + 2Ã—7,  1Ã—6 + 2Ã—8] â†’ [19, 22]
[3Ã—5 + 4Ã—7,  3Ã—6 + 4Ã—8] â†’ [43, 50]

A Ã— B = [ [19, 22],
          [43, 50] ]
```

---

ðŸ”¸ General Formula
If:
A is an mÃ—n matrix
B is an nÃ—p matrix
Then element at position (i, j) in result is:
result[i][j] = sum(A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k in range(n))

---

ðŸ”¸ Python Code Using NumPy
```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

result = np.dot(A, B)
print(result)
```
Output:
```python
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]
```
You can also use A @ B instead of np.dot(A, B).

---

ðŸ”¸ Important Notes
Rule / Concept	Explanation
Matrix multiplication â‰  element-wise	It's a row-by-column operation
Inner dimensions must match	Columns of A = Rows of B
Resulting shape	mÃ—p (rows of A Ã— columns of B)

# ðŸ”¸ What is Standard Deviation?
Standard deviation is a measure of **how spread out or scattered the values in a data set are from the mean (average).**

ðŸ”¸ In Simple Words:
Small standard deviation â†’ Data is close to the mean
Large standard deviation â†’ Data is more spread out

ðŸ”¸ Example:
Letâ€™s say you have two datasets:

A = [5, 5, 5, 5]
B = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Both may have the same average, but:
A has zero spread â†’ standard deviation is 0
B has more spread â†’ standard deviation is larger

ðŸ”¸ Python Example
```python
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9]
std_dev = np.std(data)

print(std_dev)  # Output: 2.0
```

ðŸ”¸ Formula for Standard Deviation (Population)

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2 }
\]

Where:

- \( x_i \) = each value  
- \( \mu \) = mean (average) of all values  
- \( N \) = total number of values  
- \( \sigma \) = standard deviation  

ðŸ”¸ Steps to Calculate (Example with data = [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9]):

1. **Find the mean (Î¼):**  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = \frac{40}{8} = 5
   \]

2. **Subtract the mean and square the result for each value:**  
   \[
   (2 - 5)^2 = 9,\quad (4 - 5)^2 = 1,\quad (4 - 5)^2 = 1,\quad (4 - 5)^2 = 1  
   \]
   \[
   (5 - 5)^2 = 0,\quad (5 - 5)^2 = 0,\quad (7 - 5)^2 = 4,\quad (9 - 5)^2 = 16
   \]

3. **Take the average of these squared differences:**  
   \[
   \frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

4. **Take the square root of the result:**  
   \[
   \sqrt{4} = 2
   \]

ðŸ”¸ **Conclusion:**  
Standard deviation (Ïƒ) = **2**
